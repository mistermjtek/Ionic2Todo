# Ionic2Todo
Implementation of TodoMVC in Ionic 2 beta
Based off the ionic Todo application built by Andrew Morony.

## Running the application
1. Make sure you have the ionic 2 beta CLI installed first by running:
`$ npm install -g ionic@beta`
2. then, you use the ionic CLI to serve the application to your localhost:
`$ ionic serve`

## Notes
Ionic 2 and Angular 2 are still in beta so this application will still undergo breaking changes.
If you update the ionic or angular packages in the future, the app will likely break.
